### Branch: develop trunk

This code is nearly the tip of the spear. Developers should ensure that code checked into this trunk does not break the build on common platforms and that is passes basic unit testing. Otherwise code should be left in a dev+#### or dev+xxx19MMDD branch until is is qualified. Always merge this branch into a development branch before merging that branch back here.
